# Creating the .exe version
1. Open WSL on windows and navigate to the folder (monitor_tool)
2. Run the following in order:
    python.exe      # this checks if python is installed on windows
    python.exe -m pip install --update pip      # this ensures pip is updated
    python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller       # this is needed to create the .exe file
    python.exe -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed GUI.py       # replace "GUI.py" with the 'main.py' of the codebase. This creates the .exe in the codebase under ./dist
    python.exe -m pip install psutil        # psutil is used in the code, so it also needs to be installed on windows. This needs to be done for all required packages that are used.
    python.exe -m pip install customtkinter     # used for the customtkinter gui
3. Using the file explorer, navigate to the .exe you just created and copy it to your desktop. This should now work.
